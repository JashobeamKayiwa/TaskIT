Task Management App

Problem Statement: Rabbit Haven Farm Management App

Overview:

In July 2024, Mwesigwa Jordan, a member of Group 16, conducted a preliminary investigation at Rabbit Haven Farm. The farm manager, Mr. Ssemuyimba John, highlighted two critical challenges:

1.	Task Management Problems:

o	Inefficient Task Tracking: The current manual methods for managing tasks (feeding, cleaning, health checks, etc.) are time-consuming and prone to errors.

o	Lack of Notifications: Farmers miss important tasks due to the absence of timely reminders.

o	No Centralized System: Tasks are scattered across paper notes, spreadsheets, and memory, leading to confusion and oversight.

2.	Account Tracking Problems:

o	Inadequate Financial Record-Keeping: The farm lacks a comprehensive system to track expenses, revenue, and profits.

o	Difficulty in Cost Analysis: Without accurate data, it’s challenging to analyse costs associated with breeding, feeding, and healthcare.

o	Incomplete Breeding Logs: The current system lacks detailed records of matings, litters, and sales.

Proposed Solution:

To address these challenges, we propose developing a mobile application called TaskIT. TaskIT will streamline farm operations, enhance productivity, and ensure accurate record-keeping.

Key Features:

1.	Task Management:

o	Task Scheduler: Create, assign, and track tasks (feeding, cleaning, health checks) with due dates.

o	Notifications: Send reminders/alerts to farmers’ mobile devices.

o	Task Status Updates: Mark tasks as completed or pending.

o	Dashboard: Visualize task progress and upcoming activities.

2.	Account Tracking:

o	Financial Records: Log expenses (feed, veterinary services, equipment) and revenue (sales, breeding fees).

o	Profit Calculation: Calculate net profit by deducting costs from revenue.

o	Breeding Logs: Record mating dates, litter details (kits born, kits weaned, kits sold), and mortality rates.

Expected Benefits:

•	Efficiency: Streamlined task management reduces manual effort and minimizes errors.

•	Financial Insights: Accurate financial tracking enables better decision-making.

•	Data-Driven Breeding: Detailed breeding logs improve breeding outcomes.

•	User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design for easy adoption by farmers.
